# ReactJS Document Expiration Table

This is the second visualization project. It was written mainly to solve the issue of the alternating coloring in the rows, when the rows are combined. In this project, I barely touched the useState hook, since the main focus was on the styling and persistence.

## How to Run

Before running the project, make sure the dependencies are installed.
In order to do that, run `npm i`.

To test the app builds, run `npm run build`.
To view the visualization, run `npm start`.

## Access it in browser

If you just want to take a look at he final result, i.e. deployed version, it can accessed on [GitHub Pages](https://evilcheetah.github.io/document-expiration-table/).
